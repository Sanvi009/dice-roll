🎲 ASCII Dice Roller

A simple Python program that simulates rolling a dice and displays the result as an ASCII-art dice face. The dice numbers (1 to 6) are displayed with a border for a visually appealing look.

🚀 Features

    Simulates a real dice roll.
    Displays an ASCII representation of the rolled number.
    Interactive: prompts the user to roll again or exit.
    Uses Python's random module to ensure randomness.
📌 How It Works

  The dice faces are built using loops and conditionals to print the dots (●) and borders (.).
  User is asked whether they want to roll the dice again.
  If the user enters yes, a new random dice face is displayed.
  If the user enters no, the program exits gracefully.
